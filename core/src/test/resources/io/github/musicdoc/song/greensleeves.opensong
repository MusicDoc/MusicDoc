.   Am       D7          G      Em          F                  E
 A-|las, my |lo-ve, you |do me |wro-ng, to |cast me |o-ff dis-|cour-teous-|ly. And|
.Am      D7        G       Em         F            E7         Am
 I have |lo-ved _ |you so |lo-ng, de-|ligh-_ ting |in _ your |com-pa-|ny.||

.C                    Bm      Em        Am      F             E
 Green-|slee-ves was |all my |joy, _ _ |Gre-en-|sle-eves was |my de-|light,|
.C                      G         Em          F           E7       Am
 Green-|sleeves was my |heart of |go-ld, and |who but my |la-dy _ |Green-|sleeves.||*
